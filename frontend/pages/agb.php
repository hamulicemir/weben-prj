        <h1 class="text-center fw-bold mb-5">Terms & Conditions</h1>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">1. Scope of Application</h5>
        <p>These General Terms and Conditions ("T&C") apply to all contracts concluded between ICONIQ GmbH and consumers or businesses for the sale of goods and/or services via the ICONIQ online store.</p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">2. Conclusion of Contract</h5>
        <p>Product presentations in the online store do not constitute legally binding offers but an invitation to place orders. By completing the order process, the customer submits a binding offer. The contract is concluded when we accept the order via email or shipment confirmation.</p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">3. Right of Withdrawal</h5>
        <p>Consumers have the right to withdraw from the purchase contract within 14 days without stating reasons. To exercise the right of withdrawal, a clear declaration must be sent to us via email within the deadline.</p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">4. Prices and Payment Terms</h5>
        <p>All prices are stated in euros and include applicable VAT. Additional shipping costs may apply. Payment can be made via the available methods shown during checkout.</p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">5. Delivery and Shipping Conditions</h5>
        <p>Deliveries are made to the delivery address provided by the customer. The delivery time depends on the product and shipping method. Delays will be communicated immediately.</p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">6. Retention of Title</h5>
        <p>The delivered goods remain the property of ICONIQ GmbH until full payment has been made.</p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">7. Warranty</h5>
        <p>Legal warranty rights apply. Customers are requested to check delivered items for obvious transport damage and inform us accordingly, but this is not a prerequisite for asserting warranty claims.</p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">8. Liability</h5>
        <p>ICONIQ GmbH is liable for damages only in cases of intent and gross negligence. Liability for slight negligence applies only to breach of essential contractual obligations and is limited to the foreseeable, typical damage.</p>

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4">9. Applicable Law</h5>
        <p>Austrian law shall apply, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Mandatory provisions of the consumerâ€™s country of residence remain unaffected.</p>
